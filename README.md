# data-augmentation-pipeline
A Python toolkit and notebook series for practical data augmentation, handling missing values, expanding text, and enriching time-series data for ML pipelines. Features sampling, statistical modeling, and visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and NLTK.


## Project Overview
This project is about building practical data augmentation tools for real-world machine learning pipelines, especially where data is missing, messy, or just not enough. Working as a data engineer/scientist in a fast-moving HR tech team, you’ll go beyond the basics by creating Python notebooks that fill gaps, amplify text, and expand time-series data, all while making sure the outputs work for ML engineers and analysts alike.

### What’s Inside
Step-by-step notebooks showing how to tackle classic problems: missing continuous/categorical values, textual augmentation, and time-series expansion.

Uses core the tools Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and NLTK to get the job done, with plenty of code you can adapt elsewhere.

You’ll see sampling, splitting, probability distributions, and some light OOP for reusability.

### Techniques
Handling missing/corrupted data in practical ways (imputation, augmentation, and more)

Text data augmentation (tokenization, synonym replacement, stop word handling)

Time-series data manipulation and augmentation

Probability distributions and random sampling (fight overfitting with stats, not guesswork)

Visualization and analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

OOP design patterns for scalable pipelines

### Milestones
Deal with Missing Data — milestone-1.ipynb

Data Augmentation for Text — milestone-2.ipynb

Data Augmentation for Time Series — milestone-3.ipynb

### Why Use This?
If you need to prep data for ML models, wrangle features for storytelling dashboards, or build the backend for recommender apps, this project will give you a head start. Good for learning, prototyping, and bridging the gap between theory and practical data work.
